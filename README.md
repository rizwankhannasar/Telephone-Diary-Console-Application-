## 🚀 How It Works

The program starts with a menu:

Add Contact

View Contacts

Search Contact

Delete Contact

Exit

When the user selects an option, the relevant function is called.

Contacts are stored in an array with a maximum capacity of 100.

AddContact() collects user input with styled text prompts.

ViewContacts() displays all saved contacts.

SearchContact() checks all fields for a matching keyword.

DeleteContact() removes a contact and shifts the array.
